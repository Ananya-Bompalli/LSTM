# LSTM Prediction
LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. RNNs, in general, are designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal memory or state that allows them to consider the context of previous inputs while making predictions or generating outputs.

LSTMs were introduced to address the limitation of traditional RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are particularly effective in tasks that involve processing sequences with gaps or delays between relevant events. In this repository, LSTM is used to predict the future stock price of a certain company based on the time series data provided in the required_csv.csv file on which the LSTM model is trained. The accuracy of prediction in this case is above 90% and hence LSTM prediction seems to be very reliable in this situation.

The ability of LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies makes them well-suited for various tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis along with time series prediction. They have also been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and other domains where sequential data processing is required.
